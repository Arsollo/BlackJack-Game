# BlackJack-Game

Implemented a simple Casino blackjack game where a player plays against the computer (House). The player starts with 100$ and starts betting any desired amount until they choose to stop betting or simply run out of money!
The Game consists of three files: 
- Card.py: a file where the playing card's value and suit is stored
- Deck.py: a file responsible of keeping track of the cards in the game by building a deck and shuffeling the cards
- GameLogic.py: a file handling all the game logic
